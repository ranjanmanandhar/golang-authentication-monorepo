Golang Authentication Microservice
This project is a microservice-based authentication system built with Golang. It demonstrates the use of Docker, RabbitMQ, MongoDB, Redis, and other technologies, highlighting an efficient approach to authentication and session management within a microservices architecture.

Features
Microservice Architecture: Decoupled and scalable services.
User Authentication: Secure user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.
Session Management: Redis for session storage and management.
Messaging Queue: RabbitMQ for handling asynchronous tasks.
Database: MongoDB for managing user data.
Containerization: Docker for consistent deployment and environment setup.


Technologies Used
Golang: The core language for developing microservices.
Docker: Containerization for easy deployment and scaling.
RabbitMQ: Messaging broker for handling background tasks.
MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing user data.
Redis: In-memory data store for session management and caching.
